        2. License Grants and Conditions
        --------------------------------
        
        2.1. Grants
        
        Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
        non-exclusive license:
        
        (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
            Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
            modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
            Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
            as part of a Larger Work; and
        
        (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
            for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
            Contributions or its Contributor Version.
        
        2.2. Effective Date
        
        The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
        become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
        distributes such Contribution.
        
        2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
        
        The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
        this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
        distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
        Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
        Contributor:
        
        (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
            or
        
        (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
            modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
            Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
            Version); or
        
        (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
            its Contributions.
        
        This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
        or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
        the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
        
        2.4. Subsequent Licenses
        
        No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
        distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
        License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
        permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
        
        2.5. Representation
        
        Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
        Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
        to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
        
        2.6. Fair Use
        
        This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
        applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
        equivalents.
        
        2.7. Conditions
        
        Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
        in Section 2.1.
        
        3. Responsibilities
        -------------------
        
        3.1. Distribution of Source Form
        
        All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
        Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
        the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
        Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
        License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
        attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
        Form.
        
        3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
        
        If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
        
        (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
            Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
            the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
            Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
            than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
        
        (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
            License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
            license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
            the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
        
        3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
        
        You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
        provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
        the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
        Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
        Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
        License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
        under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
        the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
        Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
        License(s).
        
        3.4. Notices
        
        You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
        (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
        or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
        the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
        the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
        
        3.5. Application of Additional Terms
        
        You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
        Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
        behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
        such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
        You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
        liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
        disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
        jurisdiction.
        
        4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
        ---------------------------------------------------
        
        If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
        License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
        statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
        the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
        describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
        be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
        Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
        or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
        recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
        
        5. Termination
        --------------
        
        5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
        if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
        compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
        Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
        Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
        ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
        non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
        come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
        Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
        notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
        first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
        from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
        Your receipt of the notice.
        
        5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
        infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
        counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
        directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
        You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
        2.1 of this License shall terminate.
        
        5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
        end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
        have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
        prior to termination shall survive termination.

        *  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
        *  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
        *  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
        *  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *

        *                                                                      *

        *  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *
        *  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *
        *  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *
        *  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *

        *  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
        *  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *

        8. Litigation
        -------------
        
        Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
        courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
        place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
        jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
        Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
        cross-claims or counter-claims.
        
        9. Miscellaneous
        ----------------
        
        This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
        matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
        unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
        necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
        that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
        shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
        
        10. Versions of the License
        ---------------------------
        
        10.1. New Versions
        
        Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
        10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
        publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
        distinguishing version number.
        
        10.2. Effect of New Versions
        
        You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
        of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
        or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
        steward.
        
        10.3. Modified Versions
        
        If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
        create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
        modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
        any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
        such modified license differs from this License).
        
        10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
        Licenses
        
        If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
        Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
        notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

        If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
        file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
        file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look
        for such a notice.

## Overview

[Agno](https://docs.agno.com) is a lightweight framework for building multi-modal Agents.

## Simple, Fast, and Agnostic

Agno is designed with three core principles:

- **Simplicity**: No graphs, chains, or convoluted patterns — just pure python.
- **Uncompromising Performance**: Blazing fast agents with a minimal memory footprint.
- **Truly Agnostic**: Any model, any provider, any modality. Future-proof agents.

## Key features

Here's why you should build Agents with Agno:

- **Lightning Fast**: Agent creation is 6000x faster than LangGraph (see [performance](#performance)).
- **Model Agnostic**: Use any model, any provider, no lock-in.
- **Multi Modal**: Native support for text, image, audio and video.
- **Multi Agent**: Delegate tasks across a team of specialized agents.
- **Memory Management**: Store user sessions and agent state in a database.
- **Knowledge Stores**: Use vector databases for Agentic RAG or dynamic few-shot.
- **Structured Outputs**: Make Agents respond with structured data.
- **Monitoring**: Track agent sessions and performance in real-time on [agno.com](https://app.agno.com).


## Installation

```shell
pip install -U agno
```

## What are Agents?

Agents are autonomous programs that use language models to achieve tasks. They solve problems by running tools, accessing knowledge and memory to improve responses.

Instead of a rigid binary definition, let's think of Agents in terms of agency and autonomy.

- **Level 0**: Agents with no tools (basic inference tasks).
- **Level 1**: Agents with tools for autonomous task execution.
- **Level 2**: Agents with knowledge, combining memory and reasoning.
- **Level 3**: Teams of agents collaborating on complex workflows.

## Example - Basic Agent

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You are an enthusiastic news reporter with a flair for storytelling!",
    markdown=True
)
agent.print_response("Tell me about a breaking news story from New York.", stream=True)
```

To run the agent, install dependencies and export your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

```shell
pip install agno openai

export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx

python basic_agent.py
```

[View this example in the cookbook](./cookbook/getting_started/01_basic_agent.py)

## Example - Agent with tools

This basic agent will obviously make up a story, lets give it a tool to search the web.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You are an enthusiastic news reporter with a flair for storytelling!",
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True
)
agent.print_response("Tell me about a breaking news story from New York.", stream=True)
```

Install dependencies and run the Agent:

```shell
pip install duckduckgo-search

python agent_with_tools.py
```

Now you should see a much more relevant result.

## Example - Agent with knowledge

Agents can store knowledge in a vector database and use it for RAG or dynamic few-shot learning.

**Agno agents use Agentic RAG** by default, which means they will search their knowledge base for the specific information they need to achieve their task.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.embedder.openai import OpenAIEmbedder
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.knowledge.pdf_url import PDFUrlKnowledgeBase
from agno.vectordb.lancedb import LanceDb, SearchType

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You are a Thai cuisine expert!",
    instructions=[
        "Search your knowledge base for Thai recipes.",
        "If the question is better suited for the web, search the web to fill in gaps.",
        "Prefer the information in your knowledge base over the web results."
    ],
    knowledge=PDFUrlKnowledgeBase(
        urls=["https://agno-public.s3.amazonaws.com/recipes/ThaiRecipes.pdf"],
        vector_db=LanceDb(
            uri="tmp/lancedb",
            table_name="recipes",
            search_type=SearchType.hybrid,
            embedder=OpenAIEmbedder(id="text-embedding-3-small"),
        ),
    ),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True
)

# Comment out after the knowledge base is loaded
if agent.knowledge is not None:
    agent.knowledge.load()

agent.print_response("How do I make chicken and galangal in coconut milk soup", stream=True)
agent.print_response("What is the history of Thai curry?", stream=True)
```

Install dependencies and run the Agent:

```shell
pip install lancedb tantivy pypdf duckduckgo-search

python agent_with_knowledge.py
```

[View this example in the cookbook](./cookbook/getting_started/03_agent_with_knowledge.py)

## Example - Multi Agent Teams

Agents work best when they have a singular purpose, a narrow scope and a small number of tools. When the number of tools grows beyond what the language model can handle or the tools belong to different categories, use a team of agents to spread the load.

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

web_agent = Agent(
    name="Web Agent",
    role="Search the web for information",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    instructions="Always include sources",
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True,
)

finance_agent = Agent(
    name="Finance Agent",
    role="Get financial data",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True)],
    instructions="Use tables to display data",
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True,
)

agent_team = Agent(
    team=[web_agent, finance_agent],
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    instructions=["Always include sources", "Use tables to display data"],
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True,
)

agent_team.print_response("What's the market outlook and financial performance of AI semiconductor companies?", stream=True)
```

Install dependencies and run the Agent team:

```shell
pip install duckduckgo-search yfinance

python agent_team.py
```

[View this example in the cookbook](./cookbook/getting_started/05_agent_team.py)

## Performance

Agno is designed for high performance agentic systems:

- Agent instantiation: <5μs on average (5000x faster than LangGraph).
- Memory footprint: <0.01Mib on average (50x less memory than LangGraph).

> Tested on an Apple M4 Mackbook Pro.

While an Agent's performance is bottlenecked by inference, we must do everything possible to minimize execution time, reduce memory usage, and parallelize tool calls. These numbers are may seem minimal, but they add up even at medium scale.

### Instantiation time

Let's measure the time it takes for an Agent with 1 tool to start up. We'll run the evaluation 1000 times to get a baseline measurement.

You should run the evaluation yourself on your own machine, please, do not take these results at face value.

```shell
# Setup virtual environment
./scripts/perf_setup.sh
source .venvs/perfenv/bin/activate
# OR Install dependencies manually
# pip install openai agno langgraph langchain_openai

# Agno
python evals/performance/instantiation_with_tool.py

# LangGraph
python evals/performance/other/langgraph_instantiation.py
```

The following evaluation is run on an Apple M4 Mackbook Pro, but we'll soon be moving this to a Github actions runner for consistency.

LangGraph is on the right, **we start it first to give it a head start**.

Agno is on the left, notice how it finishes before LangGraph gets 1/2 way through the runtime measurement, and hasn't even started the memory measurement. That's how fast Agno is.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba466d45-75dd-45ac-917b-0a56c5742e23

Dividing the average time of a Langgraph Agent by the average time of an Agno Agent:

```
0.020526s / 0.000002s ~ 10,263
```

In this particular run, **Agno Agent instantiation is roughly 10,000 times faster than Langgraph Agent instantiation**. Sure, the runtime will be dominated by inference, but these numbers add up as the number of Agents grows.

The numbers continue to favor Agno as the number of tools grow, and we all memory and knowledge stores.

### Memory usage

To measure memory usage, we use the `tracemalloc` library. We first calculate a baseline memory usage by running an empty function, then run the Agent 1000x times and calculate the difference. This gives a (reasonably) isolated measurement of the memory usage of the Agent.

We recommend running the evaluation yourself on your own machine, and digging into the code to see how it works. If we've made a mistake, please let us know.

Dividing the average memory usage of a Langgraph Agent by the average memory usage of an Agno Agent:

```
0.137273/0.002528 ~ 54.3
```

**Langgraph Agents use ~50x more memory than Agno Agents**. In our opinion, memory usage is a much more important metric than instantiation time. As we start running thousands of Agents in production, these numbers directly start affecting the cost of running the Agents.

### Conclusion

Agno agents are designed for high-performance and while we do share some benchmarks against other frameworks, we should be mindful that accuracy and reliability are more important than speed.

We'll be publishing accuracy and reliability benchmarks running on Github actions in the coming weeks. Given that each framework is different and we won't be able to tune their performance like we do with Agno, for future benchmarks we'll only be comparing against ourselves.
